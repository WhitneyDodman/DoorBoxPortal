                    <h3 style="text-align: left;">How does the DoorBox Work?</h3>

                    <p>The DoorBox gives you the freedom to shop online without the hassle of being present to sign for your package.
                        No more endless waiting, no missed deliveries, no more running down to the post office or shipping depot, no
                        more damage to your packages from sun, rain or snow, and <em>no more package theft.</em></p>
                    
                    <h3 style="text-align: center;"><iframe width="854" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jOniZ0cJN2o" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe></h3>
                    
                    <p>The DoorBox service is only $8.99/month plus, for a limited time, a low, low delivery and installation fee of
                        $39.99. No up front investment, and no commitment.</p>
                    
                    
                    <h3 style="text-align: left;">Signing up for the DoorBox</h3>
                    
                    <p>Sign up for your new DoorBox one of two ways: Add shipping, and we will send you the DoorBox with install kit
                        and instructions.  Or if you live in the GTA, for $39.99, we will dispatch a friendly DoorBox installer to 
                        deliver your DoorBox and install it for you. (That's delivery and installation for practically the cost of shipping alone.)</p>
                    <p><em>Note: Installation presently available for the Greater Toronto Area only.</em></p>
                    
                    
                    <h3 style="text-align: left;">Receiving a Parcel</h3>
                    
                    <p>It’s simple!  When expecting a package, just leave your DoorBox unlocked.  Place our specially prepared courier 
                        instructions on your front door, or on the DoorBox itself. Couriers recognizing the DoorBox will simply lift the
                        lid and place your parcel inside.  The courier records your unique code located on the underside of the DoorBox
                        lid as Proof-of-Signature. The courier then simply turns the lever to lock the DoorBox and secure your package.
                        When you get home, enter your 4 digit access code to retrieve your package.</p>
                    
                    
                    <h3 style="text-align: left;">Leaving a Parcel for Pick-up</h3>
                    
                    <p>Need to leave a parcel for a courier, a customer or friend to pick-up when you are not at home?  Simply place the parcel
                        in the DoorBox and lock it.  Then using our convenient web portal or mobile application, create a temporary code for a 
                        date and time in the future, select how long the code is to remain active, then send the code to whoever is picking up 
                        the parcel via email or SMS.</p>
                    <p>When they arrive, they simply punch in the code from their email or SMS message to open the DoorBox and retrieve your package.</p>
                    
                    
                    <!--h3 style="text-align: left;">Changing the DoorBox User Code</h3>
                    
                    <p>On occasion, you may wish to change your master or user codes.  It only takes a few seconds to change your access code, and 
                        is detailed in our quick and easy instructions.</p-->
                    
                    
                    <h3 style="text-align: left;">Installing the DoorBox</h3>
                    
                    <p>Don't have time? Not handy with tools?  No worries. For only $39.99 including delivery of the DoorBox itself, we will dispatch one of our friendly installers 
                        to come right to your front door and install the DoorBox for you.</p>
                    <p>Want to do it yourself?  We can ship the DoorBox to you.  When you receive your DoorBox, place it in front of your home easily 
                        visible to couriers.  The DoorBox comes with mounting holes and a full installation kit to allow you to securely fasten the 
                        DoorBox to a foundation or wall.</p>
